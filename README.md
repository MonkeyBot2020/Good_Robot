<h2>Good_Robot</h2>
Good_Robot is a Python Discord bot designed to streamline server management and channel migration. Utility and admin bots are dime-a-dozen, so I made this with functions that I couldn't find in others. Do note that it is an ongoing work in progress. 

<br/>Current functions:
<li>Channel logging: makes logging messages off the channel a breeze</li>
<li>Channel migration assistant: assists in migrating channels from one server to another</li>
<li>Profanity filter (filter swear words): a basic filter to help protect your channel</li>
<li>Statistics: helpful stats about the server and members</li>
â€¦and more, with new features added regularly!</br></br>
<blockquote>Good_Robot requires the <em>manage_messages</em> permission to apply profanity filter to the channel.</blockquote>
To migrate channels between servers, simply log the channel to a text file (using the <code>!log</code> command) and simply print it to the new channel using the <code>!print</code> command. Command parsing for this program was done using COMPARSE: a flexible commandline parsing module. Designed to pick out ATTRIBUTES and assign VALUES to them from a message containing many un-formatted attributes/variables.</br></br>
